   Minato Aqua (湊あくあ) is a female Japanese Virtual YouTuber associated with hololive, 
   as part of its second generation of VTubers alongside Murasaki Shion, Nakiri Ayame, 
   Yuzuki Choco, and Oozora Subaru.

   Aqua is a bumbling airhead who somehow manages to become the victim of every joke in 
   which she gets involved. She is also childish and prone to throwing tantrums, smashing her 
   keyboard, and hyperventilating when things don't go as planned (which is most of the time). 
   She enjoys playing pranks and causing mischief, but it almost always backfires because of a 
   combination of poor planning and bad luck. To make matters worse, Aqua makes no attempt to 
   avoid embarrassing situations to the point at which many wonder if she might actually be masochistic. 
   She has asked other hololive members, including Uruha Rushia, to bully her on several occasions.
